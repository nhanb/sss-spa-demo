# Naive SPA implementation

This is an extremely minimal SPA with 2 routes and using hash paths to prevent browser reload (the
`/#/` thingy).

See it in action at http://sss-spa-hash.appspot.com

While it does work, crawlers are basically screwed. Try changing your useragent to `Googlebot` to
see what I mean (or try sharing it on facebook/slack).
